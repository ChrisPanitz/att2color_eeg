02_hilbertTimecourseAndTopos.pdf:
- Grand Average within-trial time course of Hilbert amplitudes (% change relative to baseline); aggregated across all attended and all ignored conditions, respectively
- Grand Average topographies (Hilbert amplitude in predefined time window) aggregated across all attended and all ignored conditions, respectively; difference topography [attended - ignored]

02b_hilbertTimecourse_controlEOG.pdf:
- Grand Average within-trial time course of Hilbert amplitudes (% change relative to baseline) separate for participants with and without significant increases in EOG activity from baseline to cued attention phase; aggregated across all attended and all ignored conditions, respectively

03_groupStats:
- single-participant and group means of Hilbert amplitudes in predefined electrodes & time window
- distributions shown through scatterplots and violin plots
