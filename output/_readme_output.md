# readme output

Since Bayesian ANOVA with 3+ within-participant factors may take a while to compute, ANOVA output was saved into text files. Files contain the output of the anova.test function (frequentist ANOVA) and the bf_inclusion function (Inclusion Bayes Factors).

Separate files for main analyses and ANOVA excluding bad performers. The number in the file name ("excludeLowerThanXX") indicates the cutoff criterion of % correct responses to be included in the analysis.
